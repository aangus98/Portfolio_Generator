            <p>
            I am a former Middle School Social Studies Teacher who has embarked on an exciting journey to become a Full Stack Developer. With a passion for technology and a love for problem-solving, I have successfully transitioned into the tech industry, bringing a unique perspective shaped by years of teaching and mentoring young minds.

            As a developer, I have a strong affinity for using TypeScript, appreciating its balance of flexibility and robust type safety. This preference is evident in the innovative projects I have completed, such as a Workout Generator, which provides personalized fitness routines, and a Book Organizer, designed to streamline the process of cataloging and managing personal or professional libraries.

            I am committed to continuous learning and thrive on the challenges and creativity that come with full stack development. Drawing on my background in education, I excel at breaking down complex problems into manageable solutions and fostering collaboration within teams.

            When not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, staying active, and seeking inspiration for my next project. With a foundation in teaching and a future in technology, I am driven to make meaningful contributions to the world through innovative and impactful software solutions.
